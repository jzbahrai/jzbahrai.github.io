I gave my first technical talk to people in Industry this week. Once of the organizers of ExploreTechTo is my co-worker who essentially told me I was going to be speaking in November.I don't fear public speaking. I did competitve debate, Model UN and toastmasters while growing up/ through University. What I fear instead is people coming to hear me speak and thinking its a waste of time. I am so glad I got over that hump and gave my first tech talk. I spoke about 'How to build a Large Scale Search Engine'. You can find the slides for the talk at [here](https://jzbahrai.github.io/documents/BuildingLargeScaleSearchEngines.pdf).
