	<p class="lead">Hey there! My name is <span itemprop="name">Jumana Bahrainwala</span> and I am a Backend developer at a mid sized company called <a href="https://unata.com/">Unata</a>.</p>
	<p> I have a formal background in Mathematics and to some extent miss the rigour that came with the subject. I have worked at both large organizations and small ones, but I am currently enjoying startup land. </p>
	<p> My main area of experience is in search engine relavency and precision. Recommendation systems and clustering on a high level is something that also interests me. I recently moved to a backend role, and am learning how to scale backend systems so they can handle a high volume of requests.</p>
	<p> I enjoy dragon boat racing, rock climbing and competitive debating. The intersection of politics and technology fascinates me. If you read fantasy or fiction, message me your book list and we can talk about books!</p>
	<p>I am happy to talk about my work and can be contacted at the email below. </p>
