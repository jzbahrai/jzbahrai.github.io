	<p class="lead">Hey there! My name is <span itemprop="name">Jumana Bahrainwala</span> and I am a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead at <a href="https://digital.canada.ca//">The Canadian Digital Service</a>.</p>
	<p> I have a formal background in Mathematics and to some extent miss the rigour that came with the subject. I was previously a Senior Engineer at <a href="https://instacart.com//">Instcart</a>, but I am currently enjoying the public sector. </p>
	<p> My main area of experience is in search engine relavency and precision. Recommendation systems and clustering on a high level is something that also interests me. I currently work in a backend role and have expertise in databases, data engineering, scaling, and the application layer.</p>
	<p> I enjoy dragon boat racing, rock climbing and competitive debating. The intersection of humans and technology fascinates me. If you read fantasy or fiction, message me your book list and we can talk about books!</p>
	<p>I am happy to talk about my work and can be contacted at the email below. </p>
