	<p class="lead">Hey there! My name is <span itemprop="name">Jumana Bahrainwala</span> and I am a Backend developer at a mid level company called <a href="https://unata.com/">Unata</a>. We were recently acquired and I now work for a bigger shop, <a href="https://instacart.com">Instacart</a>.</p>
	<p> I graduated from the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University with a BMath (Computer Science) and BBA(Finance) in 2015. I have worked at both large organizations and small ones through the co-op program at Waterloo. </p>
	<p> My main area of experience is in search engine relavency and precision. Recommendation systems and clustering on a high level is something that also interests me. I am currently learning how to scale backend systems so they can handle a high volume of requests.</p>
	<p> I enjoy dragon boat racing, rock climbing and competitive debating. The intersection of politics and technology fascinates me. If you read fantasy or fiction, message me your book list and we can talk about books!</p>
	<p>I am happy to talk about my work and can be contacted at the email below. </p>
